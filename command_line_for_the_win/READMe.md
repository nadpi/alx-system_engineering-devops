I used SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment by writing "sftp" then the username followed by the host of the sandbox.
Then, uploaded the screenshots from my local machine and onto the sandbox by using "put -R *.png" / "put -R *.jpg" command.
Then, we can go to our sandbox and push all our work to the repo.
